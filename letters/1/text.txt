    I've decided to write one text per day to improve my english, so what should be my first subject?
    
    Of course will be about my love Diandra, I don't know if I will let you read thi but lets see how this unfold.
    
    In all my adult life I have always soutgh self improvement just for my self.
    
    Been good was the only thing that I had I only knew happiness from conquer new worlds better and faster then any one.
    
    In this process I ruined my self at a point of having auditory hallucinations.
    
    For coincidence or not when my head stopped screaming I could hear you, just like the rainbow after the storm.
    
    If you shouwed up one week before or one week later maybe 'we' would't happened, but just like all things in the universe, things happem exacly when they are supposed to.
