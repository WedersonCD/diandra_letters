    Do you know when was the first time I paid attention to you? it was in a class with teatcher Steff.

    I remember her benig a mermaid for everyone, as usual, but was this the time when you were mermaid too that was when I started spam emojis into the chat.

    The second moment that you grabbed my attention was when you said that you went to a french festival movie, it looked so fancy.

    Writting this now I see that the moments that brought my attention to you weren't anything big or too different, I just got the feeling that you were special.

    Now I can say that with all my heart with all my words: 'Diandra you are special'. The way 'we' work just works. I am realy blessed for having you. 

    Thank you
